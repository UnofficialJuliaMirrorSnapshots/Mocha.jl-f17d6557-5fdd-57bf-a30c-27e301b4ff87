Image Classification with Pre-trained Model
===========================================

This is a demo of using a CNN pre-trained on Imagenet to do image
classification. The code is located in ``examples/ijulia/ilsvrc12``. You can
`view the rendered notebook example directly at nbviewer
<http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pluskid/Mocha.jl/blob/master/examples/ijulia/ilsvrc12/imagenet-classifier.ipynb>`_.
Or alternatively, you can also start IJulia server locally by running

.. code-block:: bash

   ipython notebook --profile julia

in this demo's directory. The IJulia page will be automatically opened in your
default browser.
